            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31670:9"/>of what procured this ſhame and ſorrow to her, nor deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this time any perticular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from her yet) I doubted not but there was ſomewhat of ſhameful iniquity, and long ſtubbornneſs in hiding it, that procured this ſhame and ſharp correction. And that which made made me ſo judge was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy of God and his ſlowneſs to anger, who is not eaſily provoked to ſuch ſeverity and ſharpneſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes; yet whatever it was, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe ſhould not adde this to all, to ſay there is no hope; But know there was yet forgiveneſs, and mercy with him, that he might be feared, and hoped in by her, for ſtill this ſaying remains faithful and true, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> even ſuch lawleſs and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſinners. And God hath exalted him a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance and forgiveneſs of ſins even to rebellious, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding ſinners. And he was now u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe means to ſave and redeem her from her iniquities, becauſe mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31670:9"/>ones would not effect his end. And therefore not to be angry or frown againſt him for judging thus, for which we make it our work to hide our ſin he is ingaged in love and faithfulneſs to us to make it his work to diſcover and make us take ſhame, and if we would timely judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged with ſuch ſharpneſs and when we have provoked him to uſe ſharpneſs, ſtill he judgeth us in this world that he may not conde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore now let us take ſhame and judge our ſelves. Truly I muſt take ſhame to my ſelf for my unfaithfulneſs to you, that I have not been more watchful nor more laid to heart what I have obſerved and heard.</p>

            <p>I have obſerved that you have been of latter times very ſeldom in the Company of your faithful friends and negligent when you have been with them, of minding and giving earneſt heed to that which might and would have kept you from this.</p>
            <p>I thought it might be occaſioned through the troubles and cares of of this world coming on you by your neceſſity and ſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31670:10"/>and hoping of getting ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or relief by ſuch friendſhip, which though very evil, yet I was the leſs ſevere in judgeing becauſe of your poor condition, and thought rather firſt to ſeek to take away the occaſion by ſuch means as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But did now ſee cauſe to blame my ſelf, and therefore could the more pitty her, and earneſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that ſhe and we all might now take notice, that God would by no means allow, or ſuffer it in thoſe that make mention of his name; and keep company with thoſe that call upon him in truth, <hi>To have fellowſhip with others in their unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And in their merry meetings, and revellings (in which alſo it is a ſhame to ſpeak of thoſe things that are done of them in ſecret) but would more ſeverely correct it in them then in others that know not God.</p>
            <p>I deſired her to acknowledge to Gods glory whether ſhe had not been more a frequenter of ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings that are indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,

            <p>Upon this ſhe freely confeſſed, that ſhe had been ſo formerly until ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity had got dominion over her. But ſince that ſhe feared her being with childe, and was alſo made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the pitty and kindneſs of her friends, who knew not what ſhe had done; ſhe was filled with ſhame fear and horrour, and had not frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch evil company. But earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begged of the Lord, to forgive and hide her ſin, and cover her ſhame, and not make her a reproach to the fooliſh, which alſo ſhe was perſwaded, he would have done for her had the at laſt obeyed his voice, ſpeaking to her when alone, and by his ſervants when ſhe was ſometime in their company, Admoniſhing and moving powerfully no longer to hide her ſin but to declare her ways to ſome faithful friends that might pitty and pray for her, and ſeek her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31670:11"/>help and healing. And ſhe many times was reſolved to do it, and yet could not when ſhe had opportunity they that ſhe thought ſhe could moſt freely have opened her ſelf too, not firſt finding her out, nor being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of any ſuch thing; ſhe knew not how to break the Ice, but ſtill full of ſhame and guilt came ſeldom among them, and when ſhe did, met with ſuch powerful reproofs as made her afraid and aſhamed of them, as if they had known all that was in her heart, and ſeen all her ways; which reproofs of inſtruction had ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted too, and been willing to take ſhame with her faithful friends ſhe knew ſhe ſhould have met with help and healing, and might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this that was now come upon her, but ſhe refuſed to take ſhame, and now the Lord had ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above her in the thing in which ſhe dealt ſtubbornly and proudly, and now he had made her willing to accept of this ſhame as a juſt and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious puniſhment of her iniquity, &amp; ſhe now ſaw that all this was needful
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31670:12"/>to bring down her heart. And yet could not but hope in his mercy, that by his thus judging her in this world, he would ſave and redeem her from her iniquities, and deliver her ſoul from going down into the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Afterward my wife and I being with her alone; ſhe declared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her ways of iniquity, and deeds of darkneſs more particularly, but (as I feared, and told her) with too much extenuating, hiding, and excuſing, and ſo much ſhe confeſſed the next time I was with her. Alaſs ſaid ſhe, I have yet ſought to hide my ſin, and to excuſe it and put off as much as I could of the blame and ſhame of it from my ſelf even in my confeſſions of it to you. But God hath found me out, and made you an inſtrument of ſhowing me the dark corners of my heart. I think you know me, better then I do my ſelf, I confeſs you have diſcovered the root of all this evil, and of mine iniquities getting ſuch dominion over me. The Idolatrous eſteem I had of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31670:12"/>having a ſelf ſufficiency in my own hand of thoſe things, God was rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from us, this love of money made me unwilling to ſubmit to Gods cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of that nature, and laid me open to ſuch temptations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeilded too promiſed help in the things my ſoul luſted after; and though ſtill God croſſed me in all yet my purpoſe being not broken, but my heart inclined to its covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I went on frowardly, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly after the way of mine own heart, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I believe and am verily perſwaded ſhe then hid nothing, but by degrees as ſhe could and had opportunity, did declare her ways, and backſlid— ings wherein ſhe had tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord, and his people even from the firſt to the laſt of theſe her wandrings that had brought her to this ſhame; and did very much take the ſhame of all to her ſelf, yet ſtill always ſaid that ſuch iniquities of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs and uncleanneſs of the fleſh, as were now become hers, were not ſo formerly, nor had ſhe ſuch natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31670:13"/>promptneſs, that way for temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to work upon, but did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deteſt and abhor it all her young time both ſingle and married, and therefere her iniquity was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in yeilding, and ſuffering her ſelf to be over come as ſhe had done; but having once given way to and dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with temptations, thinking her ſelf ſtrong enough to reſiſt them, when ſhe would, ſin got dominion over her, and it became more then her own iniquity, and then ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to keep a name Among her friends, was unwilling to reveal her temptations, ſnares and weakneſſes to them, and ſo got no deliverance. Yea though many times filled with horrour? yet was there a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire cheriſhed to hide and hold faſt deceite, a refuſing to return. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God was righteous in all, and gracious in thus judging ſhe oft fully abundantly, and freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and did very much abhor her ſelf, as more vile then we could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine; and did willingly accept of the puniſhment of her iniquity in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31670:13"/>ſhame brought upon her, and that becauſe ſhe ſaw by faith, that there was yet help for her in the name of the Lord, though ſhe had deſtroyed her ſelf. And indeed ſhe was much helped by it, and being through a deep fence of her need engaged to a more earneſt giving heed to the things ſhe had heard, and that ſhe might now know them as ſhe ought to know them, more ſeriouſly then ever giving attention to reading, to exhortation and doctrine ſhe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much in the time of her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and grew to a more clear and right underſtanding of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt: and of the great things therein belonging to her peace; and God did create the fruit of his lips in that gracious word peace to her, which led her with great deſire and delight to exerciſe her ſelf therein day and right, ſhe much longed after the company of her faithful friends, and bewailed her neglect and ſlighting ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, as now her ſoul thirſted after.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:31670:14"/>
            <p>She was much converſant in a little Book lent her (Intituled <hi>Inſtructions to the Living from the conſideration of the future ſtate of the Dead</hi>) in which Gods imputing righteouſneſs with out works; and juſtifying the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and things pertaining thereto is treated of, ſo that it became her own in reading, and ſearching the Scripturns, <hi>whether thoſe things were ſo;</hi> and was much affected with it, and appeared to have met with much help to her underſtanding, increaſe and ſtrengthening to her faith and hope, through ſo weak a means, which yet to her was not weak, ſhe could not but commend it to others, and deſire them to read it. After which I gave her my Papers that are now made publick (Intituled <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Cendemned</hi>) which ſhe oft red, and ſeriouſly pondred both in the Manuſcript, and after they came out in Print, and deſired many others to read, and conſider the ſame as that in whith ſhe met with great help, and mercy, and others might in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be helped with that which would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31670:14"/>preſerve and deliver them from ſuch ſins, and ſnares as ſhe had fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>She was much exerciſed in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the Goſpel, and ſeemed to have much right underſtanding in it, and help by it, and met with ſuch refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the conſideration of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers receiving him with ſo great joy, and in ſuch manner as is there expreſſed as would not let go, but pleaded for, and ſtil rejoyced in though ſhe met with ſome repulſes: ſomething like the woman of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was in her whole carriage a mixture of paſſionate ſorrow, and tears in the remembrance of her ſinnes, and conſideration of the ſhame brought on herſelf and frinds, and occaſion given to the adverſary, to blaſpheme that worthy name cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon her, yet never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope in the mercy of God through Jeſus Chriſt: which indeed truly melted and broke her heart.

            <p>She had ſome injury, by being put in hopes of ſaveing this life by ſome that it may be might have done more then they did (had they had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for her) in order to the ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yet the moſt that I perceived her cheriſhing ſuch a hope, was from a miſtake of her own through which ſhe perceived that which was right; I had it from her ſelf.</p>
            <p>I cannot (ſaid ſhe) be without hope of Gods mercy in delivering

Nor did he dye in death, or fail of his undertaking, and work, but therein and thereby declared the workes of the Lord, the Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his Name in his ſufferings, and glorified it again in raiſing him, and giving him glory &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As myſtically conſidered in his body the Church, who though chaſtened ſore yet are not ſo given over to death; but that a ſeed of them is preſerved to call upon him, and declare all his wonderful works, and his word that he hath put in his mouth, and in the mouth of his ſeed, which ſhall not depart, and in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and ſecondary fence, it might be ſpoken of <hi>David;</hi> yet he did dye and was buried, and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchure ſaith the Apoſtle is with us to this day. But, he was not cut off untimely, but preſerved to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to which he was called, and fit in his generation, and to finiſh his courſe with joy. He was yet a little longer ſpared to declare the works
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31670:18"/>of the Lord. And I would not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: but this ſcripture might be brought to her mind by the ſpirit of the Lord, to comfort and encourage her ſoul with this: that he that was chaſtened ſore and dyed, yet was not given over to death, but was raiſed and ever liveth to make interceſſion for her, and to declare the works of the Lord, that ſhe made her ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much uncapable of declaring to Gods praiſe, and to declare his works in her, and in delivering from blood guiltineſs, that ſhe alſo might declare there while that ſhe had breath here: and this gives ground of encouragement that ſhe ſhould not dye in dying, but in ſuch wiſe live (becauſe he lives) as that the works of the Lord might further be declared in and by her; and he know how to magnifie his name in and by her death, as well as by her life, nor did this give any ground to hope for this life.</p>

            <p>I anſwered I did not think, it had ſo much impreſſion on her ſpirit, I mean her miſtaken application of it, and truly I did not the leſs but the more fear her death by the hand of Juſtice, in that ſhe was ſo ready to catch at any thing, and to compaſs herſelf with ſparks, as even to apply that to her ſelf which was ſpoken of the Son of God, to gather hopes of this preſent life from, and not more bowed to accept of the puniſhment of her iniquity: in any thing God ſhould order as to this life for the hopes ſake ſet before her; and ſpoke ſomething further to the opening it again, then I muſt let it go, and I thank God it doth not much trouble me to part with it for nothing of my hope as to eternal life goes with it, that which hath quickned me to that, &amp; nouriſheth that, is the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for my offences, &amp; the Name
